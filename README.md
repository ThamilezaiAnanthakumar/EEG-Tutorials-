## ðŸ§ EEG Preprocessing and N170 Exploration

Electroencephalography (EEG) data is complex and often noisy, requiring careful preprocessing before meaningful analysis or machine learning can be applied. Understanding EEG data acquisition and preprocessing is essential before working on EEG-based applications. Key areas include:

* **How EEG data is acquired**
* **Proper electrode placement**, such as the 10â€“20 system
* **Signal preprocessing techniques**: filtering, artifact handling, and feature extraction

In this repository, I document my hands-on exploration and learning of EEG preprocessing techniques, including:

* **Basics of EEG signal structure**
* **N170 component analysis**: N170 is an event-related potential (ERP) that occurs approximately 170 ms after visual stimuli and is associated with facial recognition. It can be used to differentiate human faces from non-faces, and has potential as a tool in autism research.
* **Common preprocessing pipelines**: filtering, outlier removal, artifact handling
* **Practical implementations**: using Python, MNE, and other EEG tools
* **Notes on electrode systems**: including the 10â€“20 placement standard, with emphasis on frontal electrodes like AF3 and AF4

This repository reflects my journey toward building a solid foundation in EEG processing, supporting future work in **brainâ€“computer interfaces (BCI), cognitive monitoring, and health diagnostics**.
