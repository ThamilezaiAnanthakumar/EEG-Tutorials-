## ðŸ§  EEG Signal Preprocessing â€“ Learning & Exploration

Electroencephalography (EEG) data is complex and often noisy, requiring careful preprocessing before meaningful analysis or machine learning can be applied. Before working on EEG-based applications, itâ€™s essential to understand:

* How EEG data is acquired
* Proper electrode placement
* Signal preprocessing techniques like filtering, artifact removal, and feature extraction

In this repository, Iâ€™ve started learning and documenting EEG preprocessing techniques through hands-on exploration and tutorials. This includes:

* Basics of EEG signal structure
* Common preprocessing pipelines
* Practical implementation using Python and MNE (or other tools you use)
* Notes on electrode systems like the 10â€“20 placement standard

This repo reflects my journey in building a solid foundation in EEG processing, aiming to support future work in areas like BCI, cognitive monitoring, and health diagnostics.
